# My Introductory Setup Journey
A documentation showing my setup  journey for the Aurora Robotics Workshop 2025

Week 1 was actually a pretty exciting journey as I got to learn to properly navigate Github and understand how to collaborate on Github. 
I have only had a very passive knowledge on Github but then,I am right on it now.

This workshop started with the installation of necessary frameworks and tools like ROS2, Gazebo, RViz and Git for version Control.
I already had ubuntu installed (dualboot) --Ubuntu 24.04 and RO2 as well (Jazzy jalisco).
I learnt to properly install Gazebo and RViz; and because I love visually appealing models, it was such a beautiful sight to behold!

I am really looking to explore most of these tools btw!

After the Installation Class, we had another preliminary class on Git and Github.
