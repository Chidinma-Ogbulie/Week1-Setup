# Tools Used in This Class (Git and Github Class)

During this class, I worked with a few essential tools to understand how version control and collaboration work in software projects.

---

### Git
**Git** is a version control system that helps track changes in files and manage project history.  
It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.  
Using Git, I learned how to initialize repositories, make commits, and push updates to remote repositories.

### GitHub
**GitHub** is an online platform that hosts Git repositories.  
It makes collaboration easier by allowing developers to share code, open pull requests, and review changes.  
Through GitHub, I learned how to create repositories, fork and clone projects, and contribute using pull requests.

### Ubuntu Terminal
The **Ubuntu terminal** served as my main interface for interacting with Git and GitHub.  
It allowed me to run Git commands, navigate directories, and manage repositories efficiently.  
Using the terminal improved my understanding of command-line operations and how developers control their workflows directly from the shell.
